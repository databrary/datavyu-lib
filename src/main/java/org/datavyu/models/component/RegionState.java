 * Represents a contiguous subset of the OpenSHAPA time line that play back and navigation of data tracks will be restricted to.

 * For thread safety, any code that works with regions should retrieve a reference to a <code>Region</code> object <b>once</b>
 * and make all subsequent calls for the current task through the <b>same</b> object, e.g.:
 * <p>
 * <code>
 *     final Region region = regionController.getRegion();
 *     final long duration = region.getRegionEnd() - region.getRegionStart() + 1;
 *     assert duration == region.getRegionDuration();
