/**
 * Defines constraints of the tracks view. The properties of this object are immutable like with {@link java.lang.String} objects.
 * <p>
 * For thread safety, any code that works with viewports should retrieve a reference to a <code>Viewport</code> object <b>once</b>
 * and make all subsequent calls for the current task through the <b>same</b> object, e.g.:
 * <p>
 * <code>
 *     final ViewportState viewport = controller.getViewport();
 *     final long viewStart = viewport.getViewStart();
 *     final long viewEnd = viewport.getViewEnd();
 *     final long timestamp = ...
 *     final boolean isTimeInViewport = viewStart <= timestamp && timestamp <= viewEnd; 
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * Viewports may change on another thread, therefore you should <b>NOT</b> write code in the following way:
 * <p>
 * <code>
 *     final long viewStart = controller.getViewport().getViewStart(); // THIS IS WRONG!!!
 *     final long viewEnd = controller.getViewport().getViewEnd();     // THIS IS WRONG!!!
 *     final long timestamp = ...
 *     final boolean isTimeInViewport = viewStart <= timestamp && timestamp <= viewEnd();
